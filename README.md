This repo serves as the main storage for Patience, the model rocket I designed from scratch. The rocket's electronic bay consists of a rpi pico, IMU, LoRA Transceiver, and GPS module.  The electronics for the launchpad consist of a RPI Pico, LoRA Transceiver, and an H-bridge to ignite the rocket remotely.  The command center for the rocket is made up of a RPI 4B, Arduino Due, LoRA Transceiver, 5.8 dBi Antenna, 50 GB SSD, and a 5v 6 amp powersupply.
